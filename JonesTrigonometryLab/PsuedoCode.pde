//OK, so first, the easiest; the sun. the sun dosnt move so just ellispe. Then, create the earth. the earth will need an x and a y? yeah, that'll be the center and the point on the unit circle that's being rotated. it'll probably coincide with the a and b from the other trigonometry circle.
//I might just have to give up the speed and incrementation of the x and y position unless I can get that to go as a function of trigonometry or something. There's also push and op matrix that i might need to use...but that might just be inter-shape rotation and not a shape being rotated aroudn something? research that.
//but for now, I'm going to paste the stuff form the past trigonometry lab and experiment with it. Try to get a circle to be drawn and then set the point moving as the center of the circel.
//void circle(float a, float b, float r ){
//  loadPixels();
//  pixelBigger(a,b);
//  pixels[int(b)*width+int(a)]=color (0);
//  for (int angle=0; angle<100000*PI; angle++) {
//  pixels[int((b+r*sin(angle)))*width+int(a+r*cos(angle))]=color (0);
//  }
//  updatePixels();
  
//}
//so we have the center of the unit circle. I don't know how to represent that. Oh wait, that's a and b. so, a and b is the center of the sun, and a+r*cos(angle) is the x of the center of the earth and b+r*sin(angle) is the y of the cetner of the earth.
