//OK, so first, the easiest; the sun. the sun dosnt move so just ellispe. Then, create the earth. the earth will need an x and a y? yeah, that'll be the center and the point on the unit circle that's being rotated. it'll probably coincide with the a and b from the other trigonometry circle.
//I might just have to give up the speed and incrementation of the x and y position unless I can get that to go as a function of trigonometry or something. There's also push and op matrix that i might need to use...but that might just be inter-shape rotation and not a shape being rotated aroudn something? research that.
//but for now, I'm going to paste the stuff form the past trigonometry lab and experiment with it. Try to get a circle to be drawn and then set the point moving as the center of the circel.
